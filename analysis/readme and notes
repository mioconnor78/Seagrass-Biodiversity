1. We should add an epiphyte qualitative survey to make sure we get the epiphytes. 

2. We need to get the data for paired shoots with our plots. 

  2014 - Margot has paired shoots with our quadrats
  2015 - Mary's group did plots with paired eiphyte shoots
  2016 - Mary's group did plots with paired eiphyte shoots
  2017 - Mary's group did plots with paired eiphyte shoots
  
  
  On google doc, Margot has a spreadsheet of who as done what.
